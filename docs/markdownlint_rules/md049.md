# `MD049` - Asterisk Emphasis Style

This rule is triggered when the symbols used in the document for emphasis do not use the asterisk emphasis style.

## Example

```markdown
*Text*
_Text_
```

This is changed to

```markdown
*Text*
*Text*
```

## Rationale

Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.

## Configuration

Add the following to your VS Code settings to turn off this rule:

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD049.enabled": false,
```

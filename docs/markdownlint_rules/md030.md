# `MD030` - Spaces after list markers

This rule checks for the number of spaces between a list marker (e.g. '`-`', '`*`', '`+`' or '`1.`') and the text of the list item.

The number of spaces checked for depends on the document style in use, but the default is 1 space after any list marker:

```markdown
* Foo
* Bar
* Baz

1. Foo
2. Bar
3. Baz

4. Foo
   * Bar
5. Baz
```

## Multiple Spaces Styles

The style guide at <https://cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide#spaces-after-list-marker> specifies that 1 space after the list marker should be used if every item in the list fits within a single paragraph, but to use 2 or 3 spaces (for ordered and unordered lists respectively) if there are multiple paragraphs of content inside the list:

```markdown
* Foo
* Bar
* Baz
```

vs.

```markdown
-   Foo

    Second paragraph

-   Bar
```

or

```markdown
1.  Foo

    Second paragraph

2.  Bar
```

To use this style, turn this rule off

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD031.include_list_items": false,
```

The markdownlint configuration options do not play well with other rules, so the configuration options were removed.  Ensuring the formatter is idempotent with these configuration options would add enormous complexity.

Ideally, the use of multiple paragraph list items is rare in properly designed Markdown documents.  In the situations where it is warranted, manually adjust spacing.

## Rationale

Violations of this rule can lead to improperly rendered content.

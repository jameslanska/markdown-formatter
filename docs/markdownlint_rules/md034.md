# `MD034` - Bare URLs and Emails

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered whenever a URL or email appears without surrounding angle brackets.

## Example

```markdown
Visit https://www.example.com/
Email demo@gmail.com
```

To fix this, angle brackets are added around the URL:

```markdown
Visit <https://www.example.com/>
Email <demo@gmail.com>
```

To include a bare URL or email without it being converted into a link, wrap it in a code span:

```markdown
Not a clickable link: `https://www.example.com`
```

## Limitations

The linter version of this rule is much more powerful, but not all issues are autofixable.

## Rationale

Without angle brackets, a bare URL or email isn't converted into a link by some Markdown parsers.

# `MD021` - Multiple spaces inside hashes on closed atx style heading

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when more than one space is used to separate the heading text from the hash characters in a closed atx style heading.  This rule will trigger if either side of the heading contains multiple spaces.

## Example

```markdown
#  Heading 1  #

##  Heading 2  ##
```

To fix this, the heading text is separated from the hash character by a single space:

```markdown
# Heading 1 #

## Heading 2 ##
```

## Rationale

Extra space has no purpose and does not affect the rendering of content.

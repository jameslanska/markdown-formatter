# `MD009` - Trailing spaces

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered on all lines that end with unexpected whitespace.  To fix this, the trailing space is removed from the end of the line.

**Note**: Trailing space is allowed in indented and fenced code blocks because some languages require it.

## Rationale

Except when being used to create a line break, trailing whitespace has no purpose and does not affect the rendering of content.  Instead, use newline to create a linebreak.

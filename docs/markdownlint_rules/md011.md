# `MD011` - Reversed link syntax

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when text that appears to be a link is encountered, but where the syntax appears to have been reversed (the `[]` and `()` are reversed).

## Example

```markdown
(Incorrect link syntax)[https://www.example.com/]
```

To fix this, the `[]` and `()` are swapped around:

```markdown
[Correct link syntax](https://www.example.com/)
```

**Note**: [Markdown Extra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown_Extra)-style footnotes do not trigger this rule:

```markdown
For (example)[^1]
```

## Rationale

Reversed links are not rendered as usable links.

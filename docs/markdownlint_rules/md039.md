# `MD039` - Spaces inside link text

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered on links that have spaces surrounding the link text.

## Example

```markdown
[ a link ](https://www.example.com/)
```

This is changed to

```markdown
[a link](https://www.example.com/)
```

## Rationale

Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.

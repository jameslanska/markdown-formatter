# `MD018` - No space after hash on atx style heading

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when spaces are missing after the hash characters in an atx style heading.

## Example

```markdown
#Heading 1

##Heading 2
```

To fix this, the heading text is separated from the hash character by a single space:

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```

## Rationale

Violations of this rule can lead to improperly rendered content.

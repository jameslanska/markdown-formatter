# `MD032` - Lists should be surrounded by blank lines

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when lists (of any kind) are either not preceded or not followed by a blank line.

## Example

```markdown
Some text
* Some
* List

1. Some
2. List
Some text
```

To fix this, ensure that all lists have a blank line both before and after (except where the block is at the beginning or end of the document):

```markdown
Some text

* Some
* List

1. Some
2. List

Some text
```

Note that adding a newline between `2. List` and `Some text` changes the meaning of the document.  See [differences between markdown lint defaults](../differences_between_markdown_lint_defaults.md).

## Rationale

Aside from aesthetic reasons, some parsers, including kramdown, will not parse lists that don't have blank lines before and after them.

# `MD047` - Files should end with a single newline character

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when there is not a single newline character at the end of a file.

## Example

```markdown
# Heading

This file ends without a newline.[EOF]
```

This is changed to

```markdown
# Heading

This file ends with a newline.
[EOF]
```

## Rationale

Moving the `EOF` to its own line improves the git diff.

In addition, some programs have trouble with files that do not end with a newline.  See: <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file>

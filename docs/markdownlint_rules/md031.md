# `MD031` - Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when fenced code blocks are either not preceded or not followed by a blank line.

## Example

````markdown
Some text
```
Code block
```

```
Another code block
```
Some more text
````

To fix this, blank lines are added where appropriate to ensure that all fenced code blocks have a blank line both before and after (except where the block is at the beginning of the document):

````markdown
Some text

```
Code block
```

```
Another code block
```

Some more text
````

## Rationale

Aside from aesthetic reasons, some parsers, including kramdown, will not parse fenced code blocks that don't have blank lines before and after them.

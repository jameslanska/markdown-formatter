# `MD007` - Unordered list indentation

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when list items are not indented by the configured number of spaces (default: 2).

## Example

```markdown
* List item
   * Nested list item indented by 3 spaces
```

Corrected Example:

```markdown
* List item
  * Nested list item indented by 2 spaces
```

**Note**: This rule applies to a sublist only if its parent lists are all also unordered (otherwise, extra indentation of ordered lists interferes with the rule).

## Rationale

Indenting by 2 spaces allows the content of a nested list to be in line with the start of the content of the parent list when a single space is used after the list marker. Indenting by 4 spaces is consistent with code blocks and simpler for editors to implement. Additionally, this can be a compatibility issue for other Markdown parsers, which require 4-space indents.

## Configuration

The `indent` parameters specifies the spaces for indent (`2` or `4`, default `2`).  Change the spacing to 4 with

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD007.indent": 4,
```

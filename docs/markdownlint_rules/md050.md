# `MD050` - Asterisk Strong Style

This rule is triggered when the symbols used in the document for strong do not use asterisk.

## Example

```markdown
__Text__
```

This is changed to

```markdown
**Text**
```

## Rationale

Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.

## Configuration

Add the following to your VS Code settings to turn off this rule:

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD050.enabled": false,
```

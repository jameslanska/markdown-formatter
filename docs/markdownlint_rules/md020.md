# `MD020` - No space inside hashes on closed atx style heading

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when spaces are missing inside the hash characters on either side of a closed atx style heading.

## Example

```markdown
#Heading 1#

##Heading 2##

## Heading 3##

##Heading 4 ##
```

To fix this, the heading text is separated from the hash character by a single space:

```markdown
# Heading 1 #

## Heading 2 ##

## Heading 3 ##

## Heading 4 ##
```

## Rationale

Violations of this rule can lead to improperly rendered content.

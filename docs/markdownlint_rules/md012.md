# `MD012` - Multiple consecutive blank lines

This rule is triggered when there are multiple consecutive blank lines in the document:

## Example

```markdown
Some text here


Some more text here
```

To fix this, the extra lines are deleted:

```markdown
Some text here

Some more text here
```

**Note**: this rule will not be triggered if there are multiple consecutive blank lines inside code blocks.

## Rationale

Except in a code block, blank lines do not affect the rendering of content.  This rule can be turned off to enable the use of multiple blank lines to help visually separate parts of very long Markdown source files.

## Configuration

Turn off limiting of consecutive blank lines

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD012.enabled": false,
```

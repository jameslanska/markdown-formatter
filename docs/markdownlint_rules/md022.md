# `MD022` - Headings should be surrounded by blank lines

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when headings (any style) are either not preceded or not followed by at least one blank line:

## Example

```markdown
# Heading 1
Some text

Some more text
## Heading 2
```

To fix this, newline are added to ensure that all headings have a blank line both before and after (except where the heading is at the beginning of the document):

```markdown
# Heading 1

Some text

Some more text

## Heading 2

```

## Rationale

Aside from aesthetic reasons, some parsers, including `kramdown`, will not parse headings that don't have a blank line before, and will parse them as regular text.

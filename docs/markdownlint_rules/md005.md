# `MD005` - Inconsistent indentation for list items at the same level

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when list items are parsed as being at the same level, but don't have the same indentation.

## Example

```markdown
* Item 1
  * Nested Item 1
  * Nested Item 2
   * A misaligned item
```

Usually, this rule will be triggered because of a typo. Correct the indentation for the list to fix it:

```markdown
* Item 1
  * Nested Item 1
  * Nested Item 2
  * Nested Item 3
```

## Alignment

Sequentially-ordered list markers are usually left-aligned such that all items have the same starting column:

```markdown
...
8. Item
9. Item
10. Item
11. Item
...
```

This rule also supports right-alignment of list markers such that all items have the same ending column:

```markdown
...
 8. Item
 9. Item
10. Item
11. Item
...
```

Right alignment can be enabled with

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.ordered_lists.right_align": true,
```

## Rationale

Violations of this rule can lead to improperly rendered content.

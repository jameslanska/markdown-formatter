# `MD019` - Multiple spaces after hash on atx style heading

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when more than one space is used to separate the heading text from the hash characters in an atx style heading.

## Example

```markdown
#  Heading 1

##  Heading 2
```

To fix this, the heading text is separated from the hash character by a single space:

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```

## Rationale

Extra space has no purpose and does not affect the rendering of content.

# `MD037` - Spaces inside emphasis markers

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when emphasis markers (bold, italic) are used, but they have spaces between the markers and the text.

## Example

```markdown
Here is some ** bold ** text.

Here is some * italic * text.

Here is some more __ bold __ text.

Here is some more _ italic _ text.
```

To fix this, the spaces around the emphasis markers are removed:

```markdown
Here is some **bold** text.

Here is some *italic* text.

Here is some more __bold__ text.

Here is some more _italic_ text.
```

## Rationale

Emphasis is only parsed as such when the asterisks/underscores aren't surrounded by spaces. This rule attempts to detect where they were surrounded by spaces, but it appears that emphasized text was intended by the author.

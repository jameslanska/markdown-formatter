# `MD010` - Hard tabs

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings, only configured.

This rule is triggered by any lines that contain hard tab characters instead of using spaces for indentation. To fix this, hard tab characters are replaced with spaces instead.  Markdown Formatter uses the number of spaces per tab set by VSCode, and as such is not configurable directly with Markdown Formatter.

## Example

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-hard-tabs -->

```markdown
Some text

	* hard tab character used to indent the list item
```

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Corrected example:

```markdown
Some text

    * Spaces used to indent the list item instead
```

## Rationale

Hard tabs are often rendered inconsistently by different editors and can be harder to work with than spaces.

## Configuration

Code blocks and spans are included by default since handling of tabs by Markdown tools can be inconsistent (e.g., using 4 vs. 8 spaces).  Turn off processing in code blocks entirely

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD010.code_blocks": false,
```

If code blocks are enabled (the default), Markdown Formatter ignores all code blocks with languages specified in `ignore_code_languages`.  The default is `["golang", "go"]`.  Change the array of code languages where hard tabs are not replaced

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD010.ignore_code_languages": [...],
```

# `MD027` - Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol

This rule is triggered when blockquotes have more than one space after the blockquote (`>`) symbol.

## Example

```markdown
>  This is a blockquote with bad indentation
>  there should only be one.
```

To fix, extra spaces are removed:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote with correct
> indentation.
```

## Rationale

Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.

## Configuration

Turn off this functionality

```typescript
"markdown-formatter.markdownlint_rules.MD027.enabled": false,
```

# `MD023` - Headings must start at the beginning of the line

**Note**: This rule cannot be turned off in settings.

This rule is triggered when a heading is indented by one or more spaces.

## Example

```markdown
Some text

  # Indented heading
```

To fix this, ensure that all headings start at the beginning of the line:

```markdown
Some text

# Heading
```

## Rationale

Headings that don't start at the beginning of the line will not be parsed as headings, and will instead appear as regular text.
